# Group 3: Image Enhancement Project

## Introduction
This project was created by **Group 3** to show how we can fix dark or dull images. We used a programming language called Python and a library called OpenCV to implement different fixes.

## What's in this project?
- **Contrast Stretching**: Pulling the range of light to make it wider.
- **Histogram Equalization**: Distributing brightness evenly across the image.
- **CLAHE**: A smarter way to fix contrast without adding noise.
- **Color Fix**: Using the **LAB color space** to fix colors without making them look weird.

## How to use it
1. Make sure you have the tools installed:
   ```bash
   pip install opencv-python numpy matplotlib
   ```
2. Run the main script to create the presentation file:
   ```bash
   python generate_notebook.py
   ```
3. Open the file named `Group3_Histogram_Equalization.ipynb` in VS Code or Jupyter to see the results.

## Summary of Files
- `generate_notebook.py`: The main code to build the report.
- `Data/`: Where we keep the test images.
- `Group3_Histogram_Equalization.ipynb`: The final report with pictures and explanations.

Developed by Group 3.
